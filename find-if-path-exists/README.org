#+title: 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph

There is a *bi-directional* graph with $n$ vertices, where every vertex is labeled from $0$ to $n-1$ (inclusive).
The edges of the graph are represented as a 2D integer array =edges=, where each =edges[i] = [ui, vi]= denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex $u_i$ and $v_i$. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a *valid path* that exists from vertex =source= to vertex =destination=.

Given =edges= and the integers =n=, =source= and =destination=, return true if there is a *valid path* from =source= to =destination=, or false otherwise.
